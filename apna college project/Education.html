  <p> I have passed my 10th class from <b>Fatima Jinnah Public School</b>.It is the best school of my area. My school is located at the distance of 500 meters away from my home. My father drops me at my school regularly. My school has a wonderful double storey building. All the rooms of my school are very wide and beautiful. There are around 300 students in my school.

    Matriculation 'confers membership of the University on students'. But simply put, it's basically a ceremony where you, and hundreds of other freshers, are officially admitted into the University</p>
